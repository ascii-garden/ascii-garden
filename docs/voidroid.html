                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Isn't this an amazing song? r-906 has been one of my favorite producers for a long time, and I think this song in particular is a return to form for some of his earlier work-- albeit with his new layer of polish. If this song interested you, I'd recommend checking out the rest of his work, particularly the songs 'Panopticon' and 'Psi', that have a similar sense of subversion in the lyrics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are a number of things that interest me about this song in particular. The speaker and the man experience the same world differently. One person sees a red peacock. The other sees a blue crow. Rather than simply accepting what the man tells us-- "the bird is a blue crow," the speaker encourages us to consider our own worldview first. It's a pretty clear request for critical thinking on the part of the listener. Don't just parrot what you hear-- or is what you see a green parrot? lol.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I also really love the way the lyrics call into question your own sensory experience and mental visualization of the words you hear! This is a definete situation where comprehension of the lyrics makes all the difference for the impactfulness of the song.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I like the fact that the bird imagery was tied into the 'violent' existence of Twitter, which has since been chaotically repainted into X. Twitter is a good example of the kind of "melting pot" of people's ideas and "blind faith" representations of worldviews. The speaker feels resigned to it, which I do empathize with.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Thank you so much to Violet for the translation check! I always learn a lot from their comments.
