                    <p>This page contains write-up on past internship and research experiences I have participated in since beginning my undergraduate education. Due to restrictions with NDA and other agreements, I cannot describe most technologies I worked on in any detail-- but I hope to introduce the fundamentals of some of the things I've worked on, as well as the stories in general. Feel free to email with any questions.</p>

                    <p>It was the morning of the fall career fair, and the technical clubs were working on creating their tabling presences for the event. I requisitoned the help of public safety to assist in carting my club's materials down the hill from the academic buildings to the gymnasium. I set up my table. My flats tore up my heels.</p>
                    <p>Katie McManus approached my display. "Hi," she said. "Hi," I responded.</p>
                    <p>"Wanna work for SpaceX?" I think the conversation started vaguely like that. Suddenly I found myself interviewing for a position in Cape Canaveral for an as-of-yet-undecided launch related internship position. I had no idea what to expect, but I arrived to find I was working on Cape's build reliability team for the Dragon spacecraft. Whatever it was, coincidence, chance, luck-- this was an enormous moment of serpendipity, and boy am I greatful. I had too much fun.</p>

                    <p>My internship this summer revolved primarily around 4 projects. The first implicated both structures and computer science. The second addressed RF shielding technology on-vehicle. The third was an automation for internal tracking and work tools. Finally, I worked on a project that involved the tools used to apply a heat-resistent material to the vehicle. Other assorted tasks included root-cause work on life support systems and a supportive role on a payload for an upcoming mission, fram2.</p>
                    <p>The major skill gains here from the technical perspective included advancements in my comfort with software development for end-users, a basic understanding of structures concepts which I did not have before, exposure to avionics systems and life support systems, and advanced my root-cause skills.</p>
