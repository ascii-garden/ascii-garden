                    <p>ENGD-110 has mainly been a graphcomm-esque exercise in demonstrating competence in engineering drawings and CAD modelling of mechanisms. The "fidget spinner project" is an extension of this. This page is an extension of an assignment mandating submission of the design via a digital portfolio.</p>
                    <p>My fidget spinner design is comprised of four pieces: the body or "spinner", a central hub piece, and two "caps" meant to snap into the hub and hold the assembly together. </p>

                    <p>The hub component can be manufactured between +-0.2mm tolerance. A final make closer to the diameter of the spinner's central hole will improve the action of the spin.</p>
