                    <h2>Getting diagnosed with autism and dropping out of school: the saga I didn't expect</h2> 
                    <p>In late fall of 2023, I left college. I couldn't get out of bed, my grades were bad, a cherished relationship suddenly and unexpectedly dissolved. The previous year, I was being routinely harrassed by another student. Throughout my tenure in college, I was hospitalized several times for reasons that could only be amounted to "stress". To make it short: I was miserable, and no learning was being accomplished. Thankfully, my parents supported me and brought me home.
                    </p>
                    <p>My mom really hates when I use the term "drop out" to describe my situation, but by definition, this is what happened, even if I dropped out with intent to return. In retrospect, this "break" has been one of the most valuable experiences in my life. I feel that less spoken about stigmas encourage us to stay quiet about our academic struggles, particularly among those of us pursuing technical fields. So I'm going to call it what it is, even if "quitting" wasn't the end goal.</p>
                    <p>Socially, I have found situations like this one exceedingly hard to explain to academic types, for lack of a better word. I distinctly recall the first time a professor approached me about my grades. For those for whom the system works at efficiency, on average, the proportion of your effort to the numeric outcome on your transcript tends to be viewed as linear. Therefore, in struggling at school, I was considered a slacker-- sure, I had extracirricular activities and summer jobs to prove that I knew what I was doing, but within the framework of recieving a degree, grades are the metric that matters. He implied I shouldn't go out with friends to IHOP on late night pancake runs, and that avoiding this kind of behavior would lead me to victory. I didn't have it in me to explain why I had never been on a so-called pancake run in my life. </p>
