                        <p>In 1st grade, I acquired a specific kind of illness called "AIBO". I joined the AIBO-Life forums at 13 and met a kind individual named WolfBob. WolfBob loaned me his dogs in exchange for developing 'AIBO THERAPY' for his repair work. This was an incredible and selfless thing to do that meaningfully opened new doors for me. I will never forget it. Thank you Bob.</p>
                        <p>'AIBO THERAPY' can be used to manually exercise the joints on most of the old-school AIBO models. This is important because the robots accumulate dust inside their potentiometers. This prevents normal function and sometimes causes complete shutdown if the robot is thoroughly convinced that something is stuck in its leg.</p>

                    <p>AIBO THERAPY 2.0 is 'PMS' software. The memory stick used must contain the 'PMS' magic file for this software to work.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that you set AIBO on a shoebox or other elevated platform while using this software. </p>
