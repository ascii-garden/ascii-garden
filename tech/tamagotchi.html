			<h1>tamagotchi planet</h1>
			<img src="../universal/monar_pop.gif"> My earliest self-cultivated interests were AIBO, Furby, and Tamagotchi. I wouldn't have physical access to these things for many many years, but things have changed!<br>
			This is my space on the web for consolidated information, hacks when I eventually create them, and growth logs, akin to the website that inspired all of this in the first place: <a href="https://mimitchi.com">mimitchi.com</a>.
			
			<h2>current egg carton</h2>
				<div class="contentbox">
					<div><img src="img/mix.png" height="200"></div>
					<div><h3>Tamagotchi m!x</h3>
						Thoroughly scuffed, but working perfectly despite! Japanese language and accompanied by two keychains. I purchased it in 2017 not too far after the launch of the m!x overseas. It's been run on and off throughout the years but is currently active.

					<div><h3>Tamagotchi Mini</h3>
						There isn't much to say about the mini beyond it being a nice acknowledgement on Bandai's part of the 20th anniversary, but it was quickly one-upped by the full-size relaunch of the original P1 and P2 Tamagotchi. Still, it's a cool keychain. English language.

			<h2>in the fridge</h2>
			Tamagotchi TamaTown and Tamagotchi Friends, both in pretty poor condition. They belong to my siblings.
			<br>
			
			<h2>wishlist</h2>
			I'd love to purchase a Tamagotchi Meets （みーつ） so I can unlock all of the content on at least one device. (To unlock all of the content on both I'd have to get a third color tama, which is a slightly terrifyling prospect.) In my dreams, I own a P2, an Angelgotch or Morino, and a Connection.
